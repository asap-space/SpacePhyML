# Welcome to SpacePhyML

SpacePhyML is a framework for working with space physics datasets. It aims to bring togheter already existing datasets for ease of usage and enable the simple creation of new datasets in the future. It is built on the torch dataset class but can be used in Tensorflow.

You can find the full documentation at [https://asap-space.github.io/SpacePhyML/](https://asap-space.github.io/SpacePhyML/).

## Quick Start

### Installation
To use SpacePhyML you can install the package using pip.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Jonah-E/SpacePhyML.git
```

### Usage

Create a dataset through the commandline tool using the dataset generator.

```
spacephyml create my_dataset.csv
```

```
from spacephyml.datasets.general.mms import ExternalMMSData

dataset = ExternalMMSData('my_dataset.csv')
```

The ASAP project is dedicated to designing and developing advanced algorithms that leverage artificial intelligence to automate onboard operations for space missions. These algorithms are specifically tailored for implementation on onboard processors, enhancing the efficiency, autonomy, and reliability of space systems. By integrating AI techniques, the project aims to reduce manual intervention, optimize mission performance, and enable smarter decision-making in real-time operational scenarios.
